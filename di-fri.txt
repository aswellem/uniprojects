# =======================================

# Can your power supply settle on a desired setpoint? (yes/no) 
#
:Reach setpoint:
Yes


# Without external load what is the maximal peak-to-peak variation (e.g. oscillation)? [mV]:
#
:Steady state var: 
I dont know

# If you change the setpoint how long does it take to reach the new output value? 
# State start voltage, end voltage and time:
#
:Step start:2
:Step end:5
:Step time: 4.03s


# If you apply an external load can your power supply reestablish the desired output voltage?
# State Set point (V), Load applied (Ohm), time to reach new voltage (within 5% band), voltage under load  
#
:Setpoint:2
:Load:100ohms
:Time to settle:~2s 
:V under load:1.873V



# If you remove the load, how far does the output exceed the setpoint [V]?  
# State Set point (V), Load applied (Ohm), maximum voltage reached [V] 
#
:Setpoint over shoot:3V
:Load removed:100ohms
:Peak voltage:5V



# What control method did you use for the above? (e.g., Incremental, proportional, PID) 
#
:Final control:
Incremental

# Over what setpoint range is your power supply usable [V]? (e.g., 4 or 3-8)  
#
:Setpoint range:
3-8V

# What current limit did you use for the setpoint (range) in the previous question [A]? 
#
:I lim:
510mA


# Your impression of the final day in ONE word:
